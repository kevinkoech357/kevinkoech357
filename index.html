    <h1>
        <strong><u>A POLITICIAN'S  CONFESSION</u></strong>
    </h1>
    <p><i> I was born for the love<br> Yet I live for the hate
        <br> It 's impossible to simulate and elucidate what I feel inside
        <br>I've got a couple of demons ready to demonetise and sever my political ties<br>So I won't break my back, I'll back their current and future plans<br> I no longer I'm the man with the plan<br>I'm just a man trying to impress both sides<br>A
        sycophant of loved psychopaths<br>So don't dare cross our path<br>Cause we won't think twice before ripping out your heart<br>We've got the power and the backing of your stupid sons<br>Ha-Ha,how's that for justfying stats?<br>I had mixed feelings
        before selling my country<br>But the shillings distorted my calling<br>Who wouldn't want to forever stay balling?<br>Busy eating cheese<br>Easy to decide which human beings<br>Will be relocated under,six-feet deep<br>A steep slippery slope that
        I cope with<br>How? I don't know<br>All I know is<br>Every night, I sleep like a well-fed innocent child.
